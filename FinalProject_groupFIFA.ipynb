    "We have accumulated data from the hit video game series EA FIFA now known as EAFC. Using the data from the game, our goal is to see if we can use the clustering methods learned in the course to group players based on several performance statistics and test how well the model was able to differentiate player positions. With data collected from the video game we will be conducting clustering models.\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior work has shown that clustering in sports research has been used commonly to investigate many problems in sports. Clustering is used so often because members of the same cluster are likely to have similar responses than members of a different cluster, and it is often easier to sample from clusters of individuals, such as sports teams, instead of individuals<a name=\"hayen\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#hayennote). There have been many projects and studies where clustering has been used to analyze player data and determine the positions of players based on their clusters. Clustering methods like partition clustering has been used to cluster soccer players based on their performance data to analyze the composition of teams and find players similar to other given players <a name=\"akhanli\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#akhanlinote). Additionally, techniques like K-Means Clustering and Model Based Clustering have been used to identify new, unique clusters of NBA players that are more informative than standard player positions <a name=\"stern\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#sternnote). Due to the prevalence of clustering in sport our project would allow people to easily filter and discriminate between players based on their performance to see what type of player they want. \n"

    "# Problem Statement\n",

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Our proposed solution is to use K-Means Clustering to group players into 4 clusters for goalies, defenders, midfielders, and attackers and evaluate the clusters by using silhouette scores and other evaluations metrics. We will also see how accurate the clusters are to clusters based on their actual positions by using an adjusted Rand index. We plan to use the scikit-learn library to implement the K-means clustering algorithm and to check the accuracy of clusters using the built in functions to calculate the Adjusted Rand Index and silhouette scores."

    "# Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining clusters from K-means Clustering, we will assess the effectiveness of the clustering in grouping players based on performance statistics by utilizing Silhouette score. The Silhouette Score measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster in comparison to other clusters, with the score ranging from -1 to 1.\n",
    "Formula of the Silhouette Score:\n",
    "$s(i) = \\frac{b(i) - a(i)}{max(a(i), b(i))}$\n",
    "Where a(i) is the mean distance between a sample and all other points in the same class, and b(i) is the mean distance between a sample and all other points in the nearest cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we will validate our clustering with the Adjusted Rand Index since cluster labels do not inherently represent the label and actual grouping, making direct validation challenging. The Adjusted Rand Index is used to compare the clusters formed by K-means clustering with the ground truth. In our case, this involves comparing the positions assigned to players within the clusters against their actual position. Importantly, the ARI also accounts for the possibility that some agreement between the clustering and the ground truth could happen just by chance. At the end, ARI provides a score between -1 and 1.\n",

    "- $\\binom{x}{2} = \\frac{x(x-1)}{2}$ represents the binomial coefficient, i.e., the number of pairs that can be formed from $x$ items.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing the Silhouette Score, we can internally validate the quality of the K-Mean Clustering and can externally validate the K-Mean Clustering using Adjusted Rand Index, comparing the formed clusters against the ground truth of the player's positions. This evaluation comprehensively captures the performance of our unsupervised learning algorithm in predicting player positions based on performance statistics.\n"

    "Some ethical and privacy concerns to address would be to address not necessarily where our data was sourced from, but how it is used by EA Sports FC. The original data linked from Kaggle was from sofifa.com and has no copyright and a CC0:Public Domain license. SoFifa is a database used by EA Fifa/EAFC, and they calculate their stats based on different linear combinations of a player's main attributes. The privacy terms of image and name rights could be a concern from EA Sports. Sole ownership of image rights starts with the player, thereby prohibiting their exploitation without the player's explicit consent. When agreeing to be with a club, the player typically grants the club partial rights to their image, facilitating its incorporation into the club's marketing endeavors. If the player is selected to represent their national team, similar image rights are often extended to the national association.1 This falls more on EA Sports rather than the dataset in which we are using it for, however it is still important to address.\n",
